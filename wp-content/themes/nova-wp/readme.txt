ABOUT Theme
=========== 

Nova is an ecommerce theme designed to work with WooCommerce. It is a child theme of Storefront so you must install this before using Nova. Nova has a very flexible home page template with optional posts slider, static page content and all the usual options for Featured, Top Rated and On Sale products. The customizer also allows for managing theme colours, logo customization, social media links and sidebar layout options.

This theme is compatible with Wordpress Version 3.4 and above and it supports the new theme customization API (https://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Customization_API).

All the image graphics and icons bundled with this theme are created by the author and licensed under the GPL.

Supported browsers: Firefox, Opera, Chrome, Safari and IE9+ (Some css3 styles like shadows and rounder corners are not supported by IE9 and below).
